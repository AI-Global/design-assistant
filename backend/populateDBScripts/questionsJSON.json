Recommended guidance from EU: Explanation (XAI research): A known issue with learning systems based on neural nets is the difficulty to provide clear reasons for the interpretations and decisions of the system. This is due to the fact that the training process has resulted in setting the network parameters to numerical values that are difficult to correlate with the results. In addition, sometimes small changes in some values of the data might result in dramatic changes in the interpretation, leading the system to confuse a school bus with an ostrich for example. This specific issue might be used to deceive the system.   For a system to be trustworthy, it is necessary to be able to understand why it had a given behaviour and why it has provided a given interpretation. It is also necessary to limit these adversarial situations. As of today, this is still an open challenge to AI systems based on neural networks. A whole field of research, Explainable AI (XAI) is trying to address this issue, to better understand the underlying mechanisms and find solutions.
