// Compute Scores
//
// There are two assessments: AI System Level Assessment and the Organizational Maturity Assessment
//
// AI System Level Assessment:
//
// Questions are divided in to two categories: risk and mitigation.
// Answer choices have a score range of -50 to 50 points.
// -50 to 0 is for risk.
// 0 to 50 is for mitigation.
// All of the questions in the assessment follow that rule.
// All of the questions are grouped into subdimensions.
// Subdimensions are grouped into dimensions.
// Each subdimension and dimension has a weight.
// All of the subdimension weights total to the dimension weight.
// Each question has several answer choices.
// Range for each question 
//

// Each of these assessments follow the same rules.
// Caveat 1: the organizational maturity assessment is not broken into risk and mitigation categories.  
// Caveat 2: the organizational maturity assessment is not broken into subdimensions.
// 
// The overall certification level score is 50% AI System Level Assessment and 50% Organizational Maturity Assessment.
// The range of the overall certification level score is 0 to 200, with each assessment worth 100 points.
// Caveat 3: sometimes the organization uses multiple AI systems.  In that case the assigned weight for the AI System 
//           Level Assessment is divided by the number of AI systems assessments.
// The final score will determine what certification level you will get.
//  0-99 Not Certified
